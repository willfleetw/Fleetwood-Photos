# Fleetwood Photos

This is the code and configuration for my static website [https://fleetwood.photos](https://fleetwood.photos).

The static website is hosted in Google's Firebase, using the hosting, realtime database, and storage features to host the site's content, photos, and photo metadata.

## Purpose

The general purpose of Fleetwood Photos is to host my finished photographs, mostly taken on a Canon AT-1 and occasionaly a Fujifilm XT-3.

Additional features include a geographical conditions page, making photography trips a little easier to plan with weather, sun rise times, golden hour times, and moon phases.

## TODO
**High Priority:**
- Move from Masonry to Isotope
- Image tagging, sorting, filtering options
- Improve navbar styling

**Low Priority:**
- Better styling for contact page
- Add info page? (Based on readme?)
- Constellation info?
