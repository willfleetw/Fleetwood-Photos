# Fleetwood Photos

This is the code and configuration for my static website [https://fleetwood.photos](https://fleetwood.photos).

The static website is hosted in Google's Firebase, using the hosting, realtime database, and storage features to host the site's content, photos, and photo metadata.

## Purpose

The general purpose of Fleetwood Photos is to host my finished photographs, mostly taken on Fujifilm X-Trans V sensor, and occasionally a Canon AT-1.

Additional features include a geographical conditions page, making photography trips a little easier to plan with weather, sun rise times, golden hour times, and moon phases.

## TODO
**High Priority:**
- Hide images until loaded, fade-in?
- update tool, make it more reliable, user friendly, and automatically create the small and mini files
- add future weather predictions for conditions page
- conditions page can make better use of larger screens, have map on right, controls on left

**Low Priority:**
- fix bug where duplicate images get loaded
- Add info page? (Based on readme?)
- Constellation info?
- make navbar hide when scrolling down, appear when scrolling up
